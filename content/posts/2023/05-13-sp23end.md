Hi all, we have a couple of reminders and exciting news!

You are suite funds ($10 per person in suite)! They will expire if you don't use them this semester.
Some ideas: suite lunch/dinner, ice-cream walk, boba order, silverware, suite merch etc.
Ask in the groupchat if you want to where to look to see how much suite funds you have left.

Sadly, move-out date is getting closer.
We are still figuring out how Summer storage for both floor and suites is going to work. HRS is not very nice.
If you have any concerns about this, reach out to me and Justin.

And, most excitingly, we are going to have an end of semester event with tons of yummy food and many many surprises!
Details are coming very soon!

Have a great last few days of school, you got this!
